NAME
	Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB::Query - Convert a database query to an Excel spreadsheet

SYNOPSIS
	use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB::Query;

	my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);

	$query = q{select user from users};
	my $ss = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB->read($dbh, $query);

	print $ss->as_xls;
	# or
	  $ss->write_xls('spreadsheet.xls');

DESCRIPTION
	This module exports a database query as an Excel Spreadsheet.  It functions
	very similar to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB, except that it forms the
	Excel spreadsheet from a query instead of an entire table.

METHODS
  data_query
	Returns the query directly to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB

  _columns_in_table
	Returns the columns from the query directly to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB

BUGS
	The same bugs that apply to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB also apply to 
	Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB::Query.  Dates are handled as strings, rather than dates.
